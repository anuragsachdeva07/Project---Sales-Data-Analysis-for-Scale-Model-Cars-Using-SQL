# Project---Sales-Data-Analysis-for-Scale-Model-Cars-Using-SQL
Executive Summary

Our client is a wholesaler that sells scale-model vehicles to businesses. Using both SQL and Python techniques, I investigated several aspects of the company's operations. Important findings include:

10 items are on backorder, all of which have over 150 units on backorder
Euro+ Shopping Channel and Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd. are VIP customers
Overall revenue appears to be increasing
Holiday spending has been stagnant over the reported data
No new customers have been acquired in the past 9 months
I used these findings to develop several recommendations for the company moving forward:

Limit the amount of backordering permitted, to avoid excessive lack of product
Host private celebratory/marketing events for the two VIP customers
Increase marketing efforts around the holiday season - perhaps offer holiday discounts or holiday themed products
Invest in acquiring new customers
Introduction
In this SQL-based (SQLite) project, I investigate data provided by a wholesaler that purchases scale-model vehicles (motorcycles, airplanes, vehicles, and trains) from manufacturers and sells them to retailers.

Company structure
Our client is an international wholesaler of scale-model vehicles that has offices in five countries across four continents. They have 23 employees organized into geographically defined sales groups:

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)
North America (NA)
Asia Pacific Region (APAC)
Japan
With the exception of the Japanese group, each group has a sales manager and a team of sales reps. The Japanese team consists of two sales representatives.

The structure of the company is graphically depicted in figure 1.
